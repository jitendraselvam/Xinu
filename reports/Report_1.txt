What is an Orphan and a Zombie process ?

Orphan Process:
A process which is currently running and  whose parent has finished running or has been terminated either by finishing its execution or has been terminated or has crashed.
Thus a process without a parent process is called an Orphan process.

Zombie Process:
A process which has completed its execution but still has an entry in the process table is called as a Zombie process.
A zombie process is created when the parent process never calls the wait() in order to read the child's exit status. 
In that case the process is still in the memory and is called as a Zombie process. 
The parent calls the wait() in order to read the exit status of the child after which the process is removed from the memory.

What are the changes that occur when the child process calls the exec system call to execute a new program?

The exec call replaces the current process completely with a new program. Loads the program into the current process space i.e. loads the text and data sengment of the previous process withthe text and data segment of the current process.
